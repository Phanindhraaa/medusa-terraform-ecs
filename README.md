# medusa-terraform-ecs

## Overview

This repository provides Terraform configurations for deploying and managing containerized applications on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). It enables infrastructure-as-code (IaC) management for scalable, secure, and automated ECS environments.

## Features

- **AWS ECS Cluster Provisioning:** Automates the creation and configuration of ECS clusters, services, and task definitions.
- **Networking:** Manages VPC, subnets, security groups, and related networking resources for ECS deployments.
- **IAM Integration:** Sets up roles and policies required for ECS tasks and services.
- **Scalability:** Supports auto-scaling configurations for ECS services based on load and usage.
- **Reusable Modules:** Designed with modularity in mind for easy adaptation and reuse across environments.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (v1.0+ recommended)
- AWS account credentials configured (via environment variables, AWS CLI, or credentials file)
- S3 bucket and DynamoDB table (optional, for remote state management)
