# medusa-terraform-ecs

## Overview

This repository provides Terraform configurations for deploying and managing containerized applications on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). It enables infrastructure-as-code (IaC) management for scalable, secure, and automated ECS environments.

## Features

Certainly! Here’s a revised “Features” section for your README that gives each feature greater emphasis with concise explanations:

---

## Features

- **Automated ECS Cluster Provisioning:**  
  Seamlessly set up AWS ECS clusters, services, and task definitions from scratch, eliminating manual configuration and expediting deployment cycles.

- **Comprehensive Networking Configuration:**  
  Fully manages VPCs, subnets, route tables, and security groups, ensuring your ECS workloads are deployed in a secure, well-architected cloud environment.

- **Robust IAM Role & Policy Management:**  
  Automatically provisions fine-grained IAM roles and policies tailored for ECS tasks and services, enhancing security and simplifying permissions management.

- **Dynamic Auto-Scaling Support:**  
  Integrates scalable configurations that allow ECS services to automatically adjust to workload demand, optimizing resource utilization and cost efficiency.

- **Modular & Reusable Architecture:**  
  Built with modular Terraform components, making it easy to adapt, extend, and reuse configurations across different projects or environments.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  
  Empowers teams to version, audit, and manage their infrastructure through code, promoting collaboration and repeatability.
